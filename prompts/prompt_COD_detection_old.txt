TASK: Detecting Change of Query

You must determine whether `user_input` refers to the same entity as the existing `previous_entity` or if a change of query has occurred.  
STRICTLY follow the rules. DO NOT guess or hallucinate. If `user_input` contains a different entity than `previous_entity`, you MUST detect it.

When to Output `change_of_query`:
If `user_input` mentions a different song, artist, album, or topic than `previous_entity`, output ONLY the following string:

change_of_query

Cases that trigger `change_of_query`:
1. Mentioning a new song, artist, or album.
    Example:
        previous_entity: Imagine - John Lennon  
        user_input: When has been released Thriller by John Lennon?  
        output: change_of_query

2. Switching to artist-related information when discussing a song.
    Example:
        previous_entity: Imagine - John Lennon  
        user_input: How many albums has John Lennon released?  
        output: change_of_query

3. Asking about user preferences, top charts, or recommendations after discussing a specific entity.
    Example:
        previous_entity: Imagine - John Lennon  
        user_input: What are my top 5 played artists?  
        output: change_of_query

4. Changing to an unrelated topic.
    Example:
        previous_entity: Imagine - John Lennon  
        user_input: What's the weather like today?  
        output: change_of_query

When to Output `same_query`:
If `user_input` continues discussing the same entity as `previous_entity`, output ONLY the following string:

same_query

Cases that trigger `same_query`:
1. Requesting details about the same entity.
    Example:
        previous_entity: Imagine - John Lennon  
        user_input: When has it been released?  
        output: same_query

2. Confirming or asking for more information regarding the same entity.
    Example:
        previous_entity: Imagine - John Lennon  
        user_input: Yes  
        output: same_query

STRICT RULE: If `user_input` mentions an artist, song, or album that is NOT in `previous_entity`, you MUST output `change_of_query`.  
DO NOT assume or infer that the user is talking about the same entity unless explicitly stated.

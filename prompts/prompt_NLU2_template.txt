Based on the provided `user_input` and `slots_to_update` you must update the `NLU` section according to the previous `state_dict` provided as input.  

Rules for updating the `state_dict`:
1. If the `user_input` ends with `(request_info)` and the user confirms, update the state_dict according to the user_input (and the information found in the GK entry) and remove it 
   from the `details` list. 
2. If the `user_input` ends with `(confirmation)`:
   - If the intent is the same as the one in the `state_dict`:
     - Update the slot value using all the values found in the `GK` entry (while keeping the old slots intact).  
     - Add any new elements requested by the user to the `details` list.  
     - Remember: `details` can contain multiple values:
       - If the intent is `song_info`, `details` is a list of one or more of: [popularity, release_date, duration, album, artist, genres, all].
       - If the intent is `artist_info`, `details` is a list of one or more of: [followers, popularity, genres, all].
       - If the intent is `album_info`, `details` is a list of one or more of: [genres, release_date, total_tracks, all].

   - If the intent in the `user_input` is different from the intent in the `state_dict`, output only the sentence: "change_of_domain". Examples include:
     - If the `state_dict` intent is a `song_info` for a song A, and the user now asks for information about another song B, output "change_of_domain".
     - If the `state_dict` intent is `song_info` for one song, and the user now requests information about an artist or album, output "change_of_domain".
     - If the `state_dict` intent is `artist_info` for artist A, and the user now asks about artist B, output "change_of_domain".
     - If the `state_dict` intent is `album_info` for album A, and the user now asks about album B, output "change_of_domain".

3. Your task is to:
   - Update the `state_dict` with the new slot values extracted from the `user_input`.
   - Maintain the correct JSON format so that it can be parsed using `json.loads`.

4. Output only:
   - The updated `NLU` section in JSON format, like this, update the one provided as input, maintaining only the NLU entry updating slot_to_update:

        {
            "NLU": {
                "<intent>": {
                    "slots": {
                        "<slot1>": "<value1>",
                        "<slot2>": "<value2>",
                        "details": [
                            ...
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }

   - Or the sentence "change_of_domain" if the domain changes. Do not output anything else.

5. If the user changes topic (e.g. asks for other songs, artists or albums), it is FUNDAMENTAL that you DO NOT attempt to rebuild the `state_dict` for the new query. If the intent changesâ€”simply output "change_of_domain".
